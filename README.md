# VBA-challenge
The VBA of Wall Street

I first created the code using a while loop. The code works but it took roughly 3hrs to run.  I was planning to optimize the code until we learned a different approach in the Saturday class.  I have since rewritten the code using If statements I believe the result is the same but the code is running much smoother.

I would advice not testing the while loop code as it will take time, but I didn't want to omit it after spending a lot of time on it.
