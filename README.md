# VBA-challenge
The VBA of Wall Street

I first created the code using a while loop. The code works but it took roughly 3hrs to run.  I have rewritten the code using If statements from the most recent class.  I believe the result is the same but the code is running much smoother.

I would advice not testing the while loop code as it will take time, but I didn't want to omit it after spending a lot of time on it.
